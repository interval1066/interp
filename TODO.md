- [X] Fix help file reader
- [X] Implement make install for help, ini files.
- [ ] Debug interpreter, seems to be some issues
- [X] Setting the prompt to the time or date output doesn't work, will need to surround command with escape characters I'm sure.
- [X] Need to check for the existence of motd, hlp, and so on or the app falls over when it assume they are availalbe and they aren't.
- [ ] At the point where I need to add that error reporting module.
- [X] Port to ARM64.
- [X] Probably getting close to time to think about changing the recursive makefile to a canonical makefile chain, or use cmake.
- [X] Same repo builds on Windows and Linux x64.
- [X] Fix stack corruption when windows version exits.
- [X] Report to the user that dependancies (like libconfig) aren't on the build host.
- [ ] Manpage? Maybe?
- [ ] Add some code that actually uses the threadpool.
- [ ] Check to see if the code is truly thread-safe, I'm sure its not (hello printf...)
- [X] Fix help system.
- [ ] Implement and USE uinfo struct in support.h.
- [ ] Add posix style command line options.
- [ ] Add case senitivity as an option (?).
- [X] Make use of encryption module.
- [X] Add a string member to the user context struct that holds the user's prompt so when user changes it it can be reflected immedaitely.
- [ ] Rename any "motd" references to "intrpmotd" or anything else, too easy to confuse with the actual linux motd file.
