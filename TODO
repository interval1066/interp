- [ ] Fix help file reader
- [ ] Improved install "thing", whetver that is
- [ ] Debug interpreter, seems to be some issues
- [ ] Setting the prommpt to the time or date output doesn't work, will need to surround command with escape characters I'm sure.
- [ ] Need to check for the existence of motd, hlp, and so on or the app falls over when it assume they are availalbe and they aren't.
