# interp
Super simple arbitrary length, "first match", command interpeter for embedded projects in C11. "Q", "qu", "qui", and "quit" will exit the interpreter, for example. Generates its own menu, super light, and highly portable. Only depends on libconfig, and even that can be removed with little effort. See the "newcmds" mardown file for info on customizing and adding new commands.
