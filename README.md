# interp
Super simple arbitrary length, "first match", command interpeter for embedded projects in C11. "Q", "qu", "qUi" (case insensitive and normalizes to lower case), and "quit" will all exit the interpreter, for example. Generates its own menu, super light, and highly portable. Only depends on libconfig, and even that can be removed with little effort. See the "newcmds" markdown file for info on customizing and adding new commands.
